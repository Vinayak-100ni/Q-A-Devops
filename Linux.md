âœ… **Bonus Tip for DevOps Interviews:**
Always connect your Linux answers with **real DevOps usage** â€” for example:
- "We use `systemctl` to manage Jenkins and Docker services."
- "We use `cron` to automate daily backup scripts."
- "We monitor CPU/memory using `top` and send alerts to CloudWatch or Prometheus."
