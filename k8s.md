## What is Kubernetes, and why is it important in the world of container orchestration?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates how containers are deployed, scaled, and managed. It’s important because it takes away the manual effort—like restarting failed containers, load balancing traffic, or scaling applications up and down based on demand. It ensures high availability, efficient resource utilization, and makes applications portable across cloud or on-prem environments. In simple terms, Kubernetes is what allows companies to run containerized applications reliably and at scale.
