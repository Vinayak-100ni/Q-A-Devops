##  What is Amazon S3, and what is its primary purpose within the AWS ecosystem?
Amazon S3, or Simple Storage Service, is an object storage service in AWS. Its primary purpose is to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time. it is highly durable, scalable, and secure storage system in the cloud. used for things like backups, application data, static website hosting, log storage, and big data analytics. The key benefit is that it’s highly available, pay-as-you-go, and integrates easily with almost every AWS service.

##  Explain the structure of an S3 object's URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
#### `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>`
Bucket name → The name of the S3 bucket.

Region → The AWS region where the bucket is hosted (e.g., us-east-1).

Object key → The full path and file name of the object inside the bucket.

##  What are the different storage classes available in Amazon S3, and when would you use each one?
S3 Standard – For frequently accessed data (e.g., websites, apps, active content). High availability and durability.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering – Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent tiers based on access. Good when access patterns are unpredictable.

S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) – For data that is not accessed often but must be retrieved quickly when needed (e.g., backups).

S3 One Zone-IA – Cheaper than Standard-IA, but stored in a single AZ. Use for non-critical data that can be re-created.

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval – Low-cost storage with millisecond access. For archives that need fast access.

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval – Very low cost, retrieval in minutes to hours. For archival data you rarely access.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive – Lowest cost, retrieval takes hours. For long-term archives (e.g., compliance data).

S3 Outposts – For storing S3 objects on-premises when data residency requirements exist.
