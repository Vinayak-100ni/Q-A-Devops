##  When would you choose an Application Load Balancer (ALB) over a Network Load Balancer (NLB), and vice versa?
ALB is best when I need smart routing for HTTP/HTTPS at Layer 7,For example, if I want to route traffic based on URLs, hostnames,tâ€™s best for web applications, APIs, and microservices.

NLB when I need ultra-high performance and very low latency at the transport layer (Layer 4). For example, handling millions of requests per second, TCP/UDP traffic, or workloads like gaming

##  What is a target group in the context of ALB, and how is it used for routing traffic to instances?
target groups act as the bridge between the load balancer and the actual backend services, and they allow to route traffic to different services based on rules like path or hostname.
