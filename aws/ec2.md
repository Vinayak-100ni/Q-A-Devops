##  What is an EC2 instance type, and how do you choose the right one for your application?
An EC2 instance type basically defines the hardware configuration of the virtual machine in AWS. It specifies the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity available to that instance. AWS groups instance types into families, like General Purpose (t2, t3, m5), Compute Optimized (c5), Memory Optimized (r5, x1), Storage Optimized (i3, d2), and Accelerated Computing (p3, g4 for GPU).

When choosing the right instance type, I look at my application’s requirements:

If it needs a balance of compute, memory, and networking — I use General Purpose.

If it’s CPU-intensive like batch processing or high-performance web servers — I go with Compute Optimized.

If it’s memory-heavy like databases or in-memory caching — I choose Memory Optimized.

If it needs fast local storage, like big data or analytics — I use Storage Optimized.

If it requires GPU or ML workloads — I go with Accelerated Computing.

I also consider factors like cost, scalability with Auto Scaling, whether I need On-Demand, Spot, or Reserved pricing, and I usually start with benchmarking or load testing to ensure the chosen type meets performance and cost efficiency.
##  What is an EC2 instance family, and when would you use one family over another?
An EC2 instance family is a grouping of instance types that are optimized for specific workloads. For example: General Purpose (t, m) balances compute, memory, and networking; Compute Optimized (c) is for CPU-heavy workloads like web servers or batch processing; Memory Optimized (r, x, z) is for in-memory databases or caching; Storage Optimized (i, d, h) is for high IOPS and big data analytics; and Accelerated Computing (p, g, f) is for GPU, ML, or HPC workloads.

I choose one family over another based on my workload needs — if I need balanced resources, I go with General Purpose; if my workload is CPU-bound, I use Compute Optimized; if memory is the bottleneck, I use Memory Optimized; and for GPU/AI training, I pick Accelerated Computing. So the family choice is always workload-driven.
##  Describe the typical steps involved in launching an EC2 instance.
To launch an EC2 instance, I pick an AMI, choose the instance type, configure network and storage, add tags, set up security groups, and finally launch it with a key pair for access
##  What is an EC2 user data script, and how can it be used during instance launch?
An EC2 user data script is a startup script that runs when the instance launches, used to automate tasks like installing software or configuring the server.
##  Explain the purpose of EC2 instance metadata and how you can access it from within an instance.
EC2 instance metadata provides information about the instance itself — like instance ID, private/public IPs, security groups, IAM role credentials, and more. It’s mainly used by applications or scripts running inside the instance to adapt dynamically without hardcoding values.

I can access it from within the instance using a simple HTTP call to the metadata service:
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

For example, running that command can give me the instance’s IP or IAM role credentials. This is very useful for automation and configuration management.

## How can you create custom AMIs, and why might you want to do so?
I can create a custom AMI by first launching and configuring an EC2 instance with the OS, applications, and settings I need, and then selecting ‘Create Image’ from the instance. AWS will package that instance into an AMI that I can reuse to launch new instances with the same setup.
##  What are security groups, and how do they control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances?
Security groups in AWS act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances. They control both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Inbound rules define what type of traffic is allowed into the instance — for example, allowing SSH on port 22 or HTTP on port 80. Outbound rules define what traffic the instance can send out. They’re stateful, meaning if I allow inbound traffic on a port, the response traffic is automatically allowed back out. This helps secure instances by only permitting the required traffic.
##  Explain the use of Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and how they differ from security groups.
Network ACLs (NACLs) are an additional layer of security that act at the subnet level. They control both inbound and outbound traffic for the entire subnet using numbered rules, and they are stateless – meaning if I allow inbound traffic, I also have to explicitly allow outbound traffic for the response.

NACLs = subnet level, stateless, rule-based; Security Groups = instance level, stateful, easier to manage.

## What is Auto Scaling, and how can it be used to ensure high availability and scalability of EC2 instances? ans in a way that i directly tell to interviewer and in simple terms
Auto Scaling in AWS automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on demand.
It helps in two main ways:

High Availability – If an instance becomes unhealthy or fails, Auto Scaling will automatically replace it with a new one, ensuring my application always has the required capacity.

Scalability – During high traffic, it can add more EC2 instances to handle the load, and during low traffic, it can remove extra instances to save costs.

##  Explain the purpose of Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and its integration with EC2 instances.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single instance is overloaded.

The main purpose is:

High Availability – If one EC2 instance goes down, ELB routes traffic to healthy instances only.

Scalability – It works with Auto Scaling. As new EC2 instances are launched, ELB automatically starts sending traffic to them.

Fault Tolerance – ELB continuously checks the health of instances and avoids sending traffic to unhealthy ones.

Integration with EC2:

We place an ELB in front of our EC2 Auto Scaling Group.

Users hit the ELB endpoint instead of a single EC2 instance.

ELB then balances requests among all healthy EC2 instances running in one or more Availability Zones.
We configure this using Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) with scaling policies tied to metrics like CPU utilization, request count, or custom CloudWatch alarms.

##  How can you configure Amazon Route 53 for DNS-based load balancing of EC2 instances?
We configure Route 53 with records that point to EC2 instances or an ELB, and then use routing policies to balance traffic at the DNS level
