## What is Docker, and how does it differ from traditional virtualization?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications along with all their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Unlike traditional virtualization, where each virtual machine includes a full guest operating system on top of a hypervisor, Docker containers share the host operating system’s kernel and only package what’s necessary for the application.
The key differences are:
:Lightweight: Containers start in seconds and use fewer resources compared to VMs.
:Portability: A Docker container runs the same way on any environment — developer laptop, test server, or cloud.
:Isolation: Containers isolate applications, but without the overhead of running multiple operating systems.
:Density: More containers can run on the same hardware compared to VMs, making it efficient and cost-effective.
So, Docker enables faster development, consistent environments, and more efficient use of resources compared to traditional virtualization
