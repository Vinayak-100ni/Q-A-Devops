The development team works closely with DevOps and QA teams to ensure smooth delivery and automation.
The company follows agile methodology, where tasks are divided into sprints, and we track progress through tools like Jira, Overall, it focuses on collaboration, automation, and delivering efficient, scalable, and secure solutions to clients.

### What issues did you face during your internship and how did you resolve them?
One common issue was build failure in the CI/CD pipeline due to missing dependencies or incorrect environment variables. I resolved it by checking the build logs in Jenkins, identifying the exact error, and updating the pipeline configuration and environment settings.

Another issue I faced was container communication failure when deploying microservices using Docker and Kubernetes. The pods were running, but the services were not reachable. I troubleshooted it by checking pod logs, validating the service and network configurations, and updating the YAML files to fix port mappings and labels.
